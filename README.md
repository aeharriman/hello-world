# hello-world

My first repository.

My name is Austyn.  I have an ecology background and have decided to "branch" out into coding.

I am going to take a moment and learn a few markdown tricks because I realized that there are a few I am unfamiliar with.

### Some animals I like (non-exhaustive):

| A type of animal. | A fact. |
| :---: | --- |
| Snakes | They flick their tongues to sample high molecular weight molecules in air moisture and bring them to their vomeronasal organ. |
| Otters | Their fur is water resistant because of its high density and hair structure. |
| Ferns [^1]  | Their life cycle, called alternation of generations, leads to there being a tiny, heart shaped ðŸ’š alternate version of the organism.

[^1]: Oh no, this one is a plant!
